  // Concepts
  $concept_one = "When a bottle is at rest, water flows out through the hole in the base, because the water's weight is directed downwards as a result of a downward gravitational force. Thus, as the bottle is falling, the outflow of water will be 'cancelled' during the fall because both the bottle and the water are moving downwards in the same direction. After the bottle leaves the hand, the only force acting on it is its own weight, so it is in free fall, regardless of the direction of the bottle.";

  $concept_two = "Pressure, volume, and temperature are quantities that are related to each other in ways that vary depending on the properties of the current system being analyzed. In an isobaric (constant pressure) process, as volume increases, temperature increases. In an isovolumetric (constant volume) process, as pressure increases, temperature increases. In an isothermal (constant temperature) process, as pressure increases, volume decreases, and vice-versa.";

  $concept_three = "A glass prism takes in a stream of light and breaks the light into its visible spectrum. You see the rainbow presented towards you, which is a separation of the individual wavelengths of light that, combined, create the visible light spectrum. As the shorter wavelengths of light, such as violet, are transmitted, the more light is refracted. Conversely, longer wavelengths, such as red, would refract less light.";

  $concept_four = "Molecular orbital theory states that different energy levels of molecular components define their spin states. An important aspect required to understand this theory is the difference between sigma and pi bonds within molecules. Sigma bonds are the strongest molecular bonds where the molecular orbitals overlap from nucleus to nucleus, thus free rotation is allowed. Pi bonds are covalent bonds where two lobes of an orbital on one atom overlap two lobes of an orbital on another atom, preventing free rotation from occurring.";

  $concept_five = "A sound source moving toward an observer appears to have a higher frequency and shorter wavelength due to the amount of wave pulses coming toward a source per second being more frequent and thus closer together in time. Consequently, a source moving away from an observer appears to have a lower frequency and longer wavelength due to the direction being pushed away from the source and thus its wave pulses move toward the source less frequently as the distance between the source and the observer becomes greater.";

  $concept_six = "According to Quantum Theory, if a tree falls in the forest, it does not make a sound, if no one is there to hear it. This is due to the fact that sound is the perception by the cochlear membrane in the inner ear canal of longitudinal wave vibrations produced by the falling tree. Therefore, if an individual does not experience these vibrations, that same individual cannot perceive and thus not experience the sounds of the tree falling in the forest. This secondary quality that exists within the human mind would argue that all other secondary sensory features would produce the same effect of a lacking perceptual experience when no one is present. So, if no one is there to perceive the color of an object, there would be no color because color is just the perception of reflected wavelengths of light.";

  $concept_seven = "Just about everyone at one time or another has been burned by hot water or steam. This problem compares the heat input to your skin from steam as opposed to hot water at the same temperature. Under these conditions, steam has to release the latent heat of vaporization as well as the heat stored in the water versus water just losing its heat directly to the external environment.";

  $concept_eight = "Legend says that Archimedes' principle was formed when he was given the task to determine whether the crown was made of pure gold in a nondestructive test. He got the idea by stepping into his bathtub, causing it to overflow, where he realized that he could answer the challenge by comparing the volume of water displaced by the crown with the volume of water displaced by an amount of pure gold equal in weight to the crown. The two volumes would be equal if the crown was made of pure gold and the crown would displace more water than pure gold would if the crown was made of another, less dense, metal.";
